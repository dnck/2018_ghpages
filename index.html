			<h1> WHAT DOES SYN-HAPTEIN MEAN?</h1> 
				<p> Syn-haptein is just a weird way to spell the familiar word 'synapse'. Most of us already have a vague idea of what a synapse is. It's the connection between two cells in the brain, right? Sure. That's it. (If you're satisfied with that description, click <a href="http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Peirce%201878%20Make%20Ideas%20Clear.pdf"> here </a>.) </p> 
				
				<p>Anyway, the purpose of spelling 'synapse' in this way isn't to be weird. I wanted to segment the linguistic root of synapse from its affix. Why should I do that? Maybe it's because I can thereby fully contemplate the historical derivation and origin of our current "form of life". Maybe. </p>

				<h2> Or maybe I'm just really bored and I wanted to learn how to code a jekyll site. You feel me? </h2>

				<p>Anyway consider the root of the word synapse: 'apse'. The word 'apse' refers to the semicircular region at the back of a Catholic cathedral. Look at an apse:

				<p>There's another linguistic form closely related to 'apse': the Ionic cognate word 'apsis' or what's the same, the Greeek 'haptein'. An apsis is an astronomical term that we currently use to refer to either one of the extreme values on an orbit around a fixed point.
				</p>


				<p>Notice any commonalities beteween these two lingusitic forms? How about this. Both apse and apsis have in common three spatial points. In the case of a Roman Catholic church, the three points for are 1) the faithful lay-members of the church, 2) the clergy presiding over the mass and 3) the blessed sacrament held in the tabernacle behind the clergy.  In the case of an eliptical orbit around a center of mass, the three points are 1) the max distance from the center of mass, 2) the min distance, and  3) the center of mass itself. </p>

				<p>Can you see why Martin Luther might have wanted to post his notes on the church door? Excuse me. I digress. </p>

				<p>Anyway, what about the affix 'syn'? That's a bit easier since the affix isn't independently carrying any meaning apart from he root. 'Syn' comes from the Greek word meaning, 'together' or 'with'. </p>

				<p>Now, before reading any further, try to synthesize the meanings I've suggsted for the root and the affix of synapse. See antyhing? </p>

				<p>What I ended up with was something like: 1) synapse n. "two dependent parts and a single reference part that function together as a unit". I want to turn attention now to Archs. Yes, you read that correctly. Archs. What a wild ride. Question. How do Archs function? Before I answer that, first a bit of historical background. </p>

				<p>By some estimates, Archs appeared in the historical record at the transition from the middle to the late Bronze age (2000-1000 BCE). A mere 4000 years ago. This was about the same time that syllabic writing systems emerged in the historical record. This is important because what a syllabic writing system does is pair a humanly produced acoustic signal with an arbitrary visuospatial pattern. It's hard not to see the analogy between an the abstract meaning I've suggested for 'apse' and syllabic writing systems. For the development of a syllabic writing system to make practical sense, a minimum of three "points" (ad I use the term points here loosely) are required - 1) a visuspatial pattern, 2) a sound pattern, and 3) a referential bond between the former two points. I hope you see the analogy. </p>

				<p>Anyway, I won't pretend to be an expert on Arch building, but I do gather this much. Pure Archs (as they are called) work by elimating pull (also known as tensile stress) and supporting themselves based on push (compressive stress). The Pure Arch is built into a reference point known as a keystone. The keystone is the center reference peice at the top of the Arch. Blocks are laid simultaneously from both bottom ends until each curved pillar structure finally meets at the center keystone. In this way, the blocks forming the pillars of the Arch push together on the keystone and they thereby stablize themselves with compressive stress. I'd hate to be the keystone in that relationship. </p>

				<p>Now, the quick summary in response to the question: what does this all have to do with the domain-name www.syn-haptein.com? Well, I chose the domain-name with the above metaphors in mind. First and foremost, I'm primarily interested in neuroscience. So in neuroscience, a chemical synapse is a special apposition, sometimes called the synaptic cleft, between two cellular pillars: 1) a signaling neuron and 2) its target neuron. Information transfer in occurs via the release of chemicals from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft. Here, the chemicals neurotransmitters interct with the mocules in the synaptic cleft. Additionally, some of these neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron and propogate with modulation the presynaptic neurons "message". There is still a great deal of mystery surrounding the make-up of the extracellular fluid in the synaptic cleft between chemical synapses. However, like the the keystone in an Arch, it may turn out that understanding the build and the strength of the cleft component will be resolve many questions about how complex congitive behaviors are implemented by the brain. </p>
