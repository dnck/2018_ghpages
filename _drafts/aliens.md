If aliens were to come to earth and study humans, they might take interest in the large class of sound waves that humans ordinarily produce. They might conclude that the sound waves can be distinguished from one another and clustered together to form sound wave equivalence classes. With extraordinary skill, they might observe that instances of these equivalence classes often appear in certain orders. Noticing that sound waves from one class appear before sound waves from another class, the aliens might form a school to study the order of sound waves from different classes. They might even theorize about the relationships between different orders of sound waves, and wonder if sound wave sequences could be grouped into equivalence classes. Finally, if the aliens were to get as far as the former conclusions, then they might argue that humans were more than just machines, and they were in fact making sounds so as to achieve their personally held goals and intentions. 

The debates within the alien community over these conclusions would probably be fierce and extensive, lasting for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But, one thing would be for certain: the overall gist of their conclusions would largely agree with the current understanding of human language in linguistics and the cognitive science.
