According to Robert Berwick, a pencil is a good example of a "combinatorial tool" [(watch his lecture on the evolution of syntax here)][1]. Another example of a combinatorial tool is the Carpenter's framing hammer. A Carpenter's framing hammer has both a hard metal head for driving nails into surfaces and an elongated forked claw for removing nails. Importantly, not all hammers have claws and therefore not all hammers are combinatorial tools. I still didn't define "combinatorial tool". I just gave two examples. Be that as it may, I assume you get the point. But, if you really need me to define it, then here's my best shot: combinatorial tool (n.) a tool that combines two tools with complementary functions into one tool with both functions. But the details for the definition seem relevant. I'll explain why.

[Stone tools from the Lower Paleolithic period (~2.6m years ago)][2] included choppers, scrapers, and importantly *pounders*. As the name implies, pounders pounded things like the heads of hammers, but they didn't have claws (did they?). Assuming that pounders were only pounders for the Ancient hominids that used them, then if we were looking for the original "combinatorial tools", the next best thing in the [archaeological record][3] would be of examples of tools that relied on [hafting technology][hafting]. Hafting is basically the process by which one thing gets attached to another thing. Evidence for the earliest combinatorial tools, or "composite tools" as they are known in archaeology, date to some 500,000 years ago [link][5]. If what Berwick means by a "combinatorial tool" is what the archaeologist means by the "composite tool", then Ancient hominids and modern Homo Sapien Sapiens would evidence for the the "merge" operation characterizing current day as unique in the animal kingdom includes
