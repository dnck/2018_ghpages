title: how are archs built?

What cognitive skills must humans possess to build archs? That's one thing I was thinking about when I visited Rome with my girlfriend. 

*Archs*
By some estimates, humans built archs some 4000 years ago during the middle-to-late and the late Bronze age (2000-1000 BC). 

Therefore, we can be sure that whatever knowledge and skill is required to build an arch is fairly old. Knowing how archs work might tell us more about these skills. 

Archs work by eliminating "pull". Pull is a kind stress that works on just about every physical thing. Pull is also known as "tensile stress". Usually gravity exerts "tensile stress" on object perpendicular to the earth's surface. But, archs eliminate pull by using an opposing kind of stress called push (e.g. compressive stress). Archs have two pillars that push into a reference brick called a "keystone". The keystone is labeled below

![keystone]({{ thisImg.url }}/images/keystone.jpg){:height="256px" width="256px"}.

The keystone is the center reference point at the top of an arch. By pushing into the keystone, archs eliminate the pull of gravity by pushing into 

To build an arch, bricks are laid until each curved column meets at the center keystone. In this way, the columns of the arch push together on the keystone and stablize themselves with compressive stress or push. It's as if archs elimnate the pull of gravity by pushing into themselves.  



*Latin Alphabet*

Interestingly, at about the same time that we first find evidence of arch building in the historical record, we also start to find evidence for syllabic writing systems. Disclaimer: the Latin Alphabet is not a syllabic writing system, so I've kinda mislead anyone that read this far. But, if you made it down here, don't stop. The topic of writing systems is supremely fascinating! 

Syllabic writing systems stand in contrast to what are called logographic writing systems. You can get an idea for logographic writing systems by comparison to present-day internet memes without any accompanying text. The most popular memes represent a concept, but they do so with visual patterns alone. Now, on the other hand, what a syllabic writing system does is pairs a syllable with an arbitrary visuospatial pattern. In this sense, syllabic writing systems are quite special and they reveal something about the evolution of human thought. I refer you to <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/sem05/Olson.how.writg.reprsts.sp.93.pdf"> Olson (1993) </a> for a more in depth treatment on the topic. He makes several interesting observations of which, I will note one. 

So there's an intuitive appeal to thinking that possession of a syllabic writing system demonstrates a pre-existing cognitive capacity to ignore dependent features embedded in a stream of experience, and to focus on independent features driving those changes. In other words, it's intuitive (to me at least) to think that prior to pairing arbitrary visuospatial patterns and heard or produced sounds, one would have to think about and segment sights and sounds in a rather deep way. The word, "mother", for instance, has two syllables. If you wanted to break the sound up into parts, and recycle the parts for use in other vocal productions perhaps with other people, then you'd have to focus on some dependent properties of the speech production and some independent properties. Some of the dependent properties might be that the particular token utterance consists of three parts, 1) vocal tract closing, 2) vocal tract opening, 3) closing again. The independent property might whatever it is that's driving that change in the vocal tract. Here, your guess is as good as mine, but some philosophies have called it Ä€tman and others have called it Soul. Whatever it is, the idea is simple -- syllabic writing system demonstrate a pre-existing capacity for complex executive control and attentional guidance by thought. 


Olson (1993) actually suggests this is putting the cart before the horse. If I read him correctly, in contrast to the idea that we need complex cognition for syllabification and in general writing systems, he argues that writing systems are models for thought. They provide us with a means to experience the complexity of experiences. They also provide us with the means to segment our experiences even more such that complex cognition is built on top of writing, not the other way around. 

Anyway, I am highly intrigued with this line of thinking, and I think it's worth investigating a lot more considering my master's thesis topic is investigating the effect of semantic category fluency and recursive artimetic on the recognition of self-similarity in visuospatial groupings. 

In the future, I'm going to learn how to code a comment box for Jekyll. I doubt it will be put to use, but it'll be a fun project nonethless.
