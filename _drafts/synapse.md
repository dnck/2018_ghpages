The root of the word synapse is 'apse'. The word 'apse' refers to a semicircular region at the back of a cathedral. Here's an apse:

The Ionic word 'apsis' and the Greek word, 'haptein', are cognate linguistic forms closely related to 'apse'. Let's focus only on apsis. An apsis is an astronomical term used to refer to either one of the extreme values on an orbit around a fixed point. Again, here it is:

![apogee]({{ thisImg.url }}/images/apogee.png){:height="256px" width="400px"}.

Both apse and apsis have in common a reference to three spatial points. In the case of an apse, the three points are: 
1) the faithful lay-members of the church, 2) the clergy presiding over the mass and 3) the blessed sacrament held in the tabernacle behind the clergy.  In the case of an eliptical orbit around a center of a mass, the three points are 
1) the max distance from the center of mass, 2) the min distance, and 3) the center of mass itself. So, let's stop there for the root. The affix for the word 'synapase' is 'syn'. Note that an affix isn't supposed to carry much meaning apart from its root, so I won't make much ado about syn. Nonetheless, the word 'syn' comes from the Greek word meaning, 'together' or 'with'. Now let's proceed to a synthesis of the sense for the root and the affix.

Synapse (def.) refers to two dependent points and a single reference point, which taken together function as a unit.
