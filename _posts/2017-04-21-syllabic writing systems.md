Syllabic writing systems stand in contrast to what are called logographic writing systems. Logographic writing systems can be compared to present-day internet memes without any accompanying text. The most popular memes represent a concept, but they do so with only visual patterns. On the other hand, what a syllabic writing system does is pair a human sound with an arbitrary visuospatial pattern. In this sense, syllabic writing systems are quite special and they reveal something about the evolution of human thought. I refer you to <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/sem05/Olson.how.writg.reprsts.sp.93.pdf"> Olson (1993) </a> for a more in depth treatment on the topic. He makes several interesting observations. I will note one. 

There's intuitive pull to the thought that if a creature can create syllabic writing system, then they can reflect on their internal states of mind. 
In other words, it's appealing to think that prior to pairing arbitrary visuospatial patterns and heard or produced sounds, a creature would have to think about and segment their own sights and sounds. A different way to say this is that possession of a syllabic writing system demonstrates a pre-existing cognitive capacity to ignore some dependent features embedded in a stream of experience, and to focus on independent features driving those changes. Let me explain.

For instance, the word "mother" has two syllables. If you wanted to break the sound up into parts, and recycle the parts for use in other vocal productions perhaps with other people, then you'd have to focus on some dependent properties of the speech production and some independent properties. Some of the dependent properties might be that the particular token utterance consists of three parts, 1) vocal tract closing, 2) vocal tract opening, 3) vocal tract closing again. The independent property might be whatever it is that's driving that change in the vocal tract. Here, your guess is as good as mine, but some philosophies have called it Ä€tman and others have called it Soul. Whatever it is, the idea is simple -- syllabic writing system demonstrate a pre-existing capacity for self-reflection, complex executive control and attentional guidance by one's own thought. 

From what I read in Olson (1993), it seems he actually suggests the above way of thinkin puts the cart before the horse. In contrast to the idea that we need complex cognition for syllabification and syllabic writing systems, he argues that writing systems are models for thought. They provide us with a means to experience the complexity of experience. They also provide us with the means to segment our experiences such that complex cognition is built on top of writing, not the other way around. 

Anyway, I'm intrigued with his line of thinking, and I think it's worth investigating.
