Is it possible to derive the current sense of a word from its historical origins? 

My intuition says, "yes". If we inspect the sense of the root of a word and any of its affixes, and we trace the historical trajectory of these word parts, then we could derive the current sense of the word from its history. 

If you share my intuition, then you might want to also consider two problems. 

First problem. It would take a very long time to trace the sense of a single part of a word. If relied only on dictionaries, then we'd still be looking at around 4000 years of evidence (oldest surviving dictionary ~ 2300 BCE). If we included ancient logographic writing systems and the human practices around which these writing systems (e.g. story telling, acounting, etc.) revolved in our stock pile of evidence, we'd be working with big data. We'd probably run out of time and die before we even derived the sense of a single word. 

Second problem. there's gaps in the historical record. Time's probably already got us beat here. It's passive claws have probably destroyed the essential parts of the records that we would need to draw a convincing conclusion. This may depend on how much convincing you need, but even if you didn't need much convincing, there'd probably be a lot of people that said your explanation of sense was bullshit. If you're like me, you'd probably feel a sinking suspicion that they were right. 

So, OK. We've acknowledged two major obstacles to the project of deriving the sense of words from a historical record. Importantly, if time is the only issue, then there might be [some words]("http://nws.merriam-webster.com/opendictionary/newword_display_recent.php") that are open to investigation, and because of digitial records, it might become easier and easier for the future generations to engage with the project (even though they'd be limited with respect to the pre-digital era as we are).
