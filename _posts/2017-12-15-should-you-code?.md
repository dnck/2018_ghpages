I discovered Jeff Atwood's blog by asking Google,

<blockquote class="blockquote">
What percentage of websites have shitty code?
</blockquote>

Jeff's blog post, "Please don't learn to code" was the third hit on google.     You can read his answer <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">here</a>.

Jeff is a co-founder of the Q&A forum for programmers, Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. He's a developer of the open source discussion platform, Discourse (maybe you've used it?) and he's the author of the blog, Coding Horror.

Disclaimer: I didn't actually interview Jeff Atwood for this post. Instead I took some of his quotes from the linked blog post, and I answered my own questions. I think he'd probably endorse the context, but if not, he can always let me know, and I'd be happy to edit it.

I’m thinking about a career in programming. Should I learn to code?
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
No, I can’t get behind that.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  What should I do instead?  
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
You should learn to understand how the things around [you] work at a basic level and also learn how to communicate effectively with other human beings.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
But there so many programming jobs out there. The world needs programmers, right?   
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
There are so many jobs in the field because one bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  Oh, damn, does that mean that the job market is inflated because of shitty code?   
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Yes, we have way too many coders addicted to doing just one more line.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Ok, but what if I really like the methods, and I wanna code for a living?
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Well, first figure out what your problem is.
