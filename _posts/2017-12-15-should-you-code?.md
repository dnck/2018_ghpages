What percentage of websites have shitty code?

Jeff Atwood's blog post,     <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">Please don't learn to code</a>, was the third hit on google when I asked that question.

Jeff is one of the founders of the Q&A forum for programmers, Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange.

I wanted to interview Jeff for this post, but I think I code (see what I did there?) answer my own questions with quotes from his blog post (see below).

<!--<hr class="faded">-->

**I’m thinking about a career in programming. Should I learn to code?**

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
No, I can’t get behind that.
</blockquote>

**What should I do instead?  **

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
You should learn to understand how the things around [you] work at a basic level and also learn how to communicate effectively with other human beings.
</blockquote>

**But there so many programming jobs out there. The world needs programmers, right? **


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
There are so many jobs in the field because one bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year.
</blockquote>

**Do you think the job market is inflated because of shitty code?**


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Yes, we have way too many coders addicted to doing just one more line.
</blockquote>

**What if I really like computer science methods, and I want to code for a living? Should I learn how to code?**


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Well, first figure out what your problem is.
</blockquote>

 I think Jeff would probably endorse how I used his quotes, but if not, he can always let me know. I'd be happy to edit it.
