title: Should you learn code?

I discovered Jeff Atwood's blog by asking Google,

<blockquote class="blockquote">
What percentage of websites have shitty code?
</blockquote>

Jeff's blog post, "Please don't learn to code" was the third hit on google.     You can read his answer <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">here</a>.

Jeff is one of the founders of the Q&A forum for programmers, Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. He's a developer of the open source discussion platform, Discourse and he's the author of the blog, Coding Horror (link above).

I didn't actually interview Jeff Atwood for this post. Instead I took some of his quotes from the linked blog post, and I answered my own questions. I think he'd probably endorse the context, but if not, he can always let me know, and I'd be happy to edit it.

**I’m thinking about a career in programming. Should I learn to code?**

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
No, I can’t get behind that.
</blockquote>

**What should I do instead?  **

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
You should learn to understand how the things around [you] work at a basic level and also learn how to communicate effectively with other human beings.
</blockquote>

**But there so many programming jobs out there. The world needs programmers, right? **


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
There are so many jobs in the field because one bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year.
</blockquote>

**Do you think the job market is inflated because of shitty code?**


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Yes, we have way too many coders addicted to doing just one more line.
</blockquote>

**What if I really like computer science methods, and I want to code for a living? Should I learn how to code?**


<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
Well, first figure out what your problem is.
