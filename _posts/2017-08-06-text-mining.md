I recently read <a href = "http://juanrloaiza.blogspot.de/2017/08/whos-most-mentioned-philosopher-in-sep.html"> a friend's blog</a> on text-mining the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. That's something I've wanted to do for a while. So, I decided to refresh my knowledge of KNN-Models and I spent some time this past weekend writing a quick and dirty  notebook for scrapping and analyzing random entries from the SEP.
