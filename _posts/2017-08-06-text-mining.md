I recently read <a href = "http://juanrloaiza.blogspot.de/2017/08/whos-most-mentioned-philosopher-in-sep.html"> a friend's post</a> on mining the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I decided to refresh my knowledge of KNN-Models and I spent some time this past weekend writing a quick and dirty notebook for scrapping and analyzing random entries from the SEP.
<a href ="http://www.danjcook.com/assets/text_mining.html"> Here's a link to the notebook</a> in case you'd like to play around with it.
