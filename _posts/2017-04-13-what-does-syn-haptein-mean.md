title: What does syn-haptein mean?

Syn-haptein is just a weird way to spell the familiar word 'synapse'. Most of us already have a vague idea of what a synapse is. It's the connection between two cells in the brain, right? Sure. That's it. (If you're satisfied with that description, click <a href="http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Peirce%201878%20Make%20Ideas%20Clear.pdf"> here </a>.) 
				
Anyway, the purpose of spelling 'synapse' in this way isn't to be weird. I wanted to segment the linguistic root of synapse from its affix. Why should I do that? Maybe it's because I can thereby fully contemplate the historical derivation and origin of our current "form of life". Maybe. 

*Or maybe I'm just really bored and I wanted to learn how to code a Jekyll site. You feel me?*

Anyway consider the root of the word synapse: 'apse'. The word 'apse' refers to the semicircular region at the back of a Catholic cathedral. Look at an apse:

There's another linguistic form closely related to 'apse': the Ionic cognate word 'apsis' or what's the same, the Greeek 'haptein'. An apsis is an astronomical term that we currently use to refer to either one of the extreme values on an orbit around a fixed point.

Notice any commonalities beteween these two lingusitic forms? How about this. Both apse and apsis have in common three spatial points. In the case of a Roman Catholic church, the three points for are 1) the faithful lay-members of the church, 2) the clergy presiding over the mass and 3) the blessed sacrament held in the tabernacle behind the clergy.  In the case of an eliptical orbit around a center of mass, the three points are 1) the max distance from the center of mass, 2) the min distance, and  3) the center of mass itself.

Can you see why Martin Luther might have wanted to post his notes on the church door? Excuse me. I digress. 

Anyway, what about the affix 'syn'? The affix isn't supposed to carry meaning apart from the root. So syn- just omes from the Greek word meaning, 'together' or 'with'. 

Go back and try to synthesize the meanings I've suggsted for the root and the affix of synapse. Notice antyhing? 

Here's the abstract sense I have personally derived from our philological excursion: 1) a 'synapse' refers to "two dependent parts with a single reference point - all of which function together as a unit". 

Don't agree? Tell me how wrong I am by email. I'm still figuring out how to implement commments and ping backs on Jekyll.

### Pure Archs  

By some estimates, Pure Archs appeared in the historical record at the transition from the middle to the late Bronze age (2000-1000 BCE). A mere 4000 years ago. This was about the same time that syllabic writing systems emerged in the historical record. What a syllabic writing system does is demonstrate the cognitive ability to pair an acoustic signal with an arbitrary visuospatial pattern. For the development of a syllabic writing system to make practical sense, a minimum of three "points" are required: 1) a visuspatial pattern, 2) a sound pattern, and 3) a referential bond between the former two points. You would be blind to miss the analogy between the abstract meaning that I've dervied for 'apse' and 'apsis' and syllabic writing systems. 

But again I digress. What I wanted to address is the question, how do Archs work?

I won't pretend to be an expert on Arch building, but here's the basics.

Pure Archs (as they are called) work by eliminating pull (also known as tensile stress) and supporting themselves based on the push of their columns (compressive stress). The way a Pure Arch does is is by pushing into a reference point called as a keystone.

As you can see, the keystone is the center reference point at the top of the Arch. To build an Arch, bricks are laid simultaneously from both bottom ends until each curved pillar meets at a center keystone. In this way, the blocks forming the pillars of the Arch push together on the keystone and they thereby stablize themselves with compressive stress. 	

What does any of this have to do with meaning of the domain-name www.syn-haptein.com?  

Well, as you may have guessed, I chose the domain-name with the above *metaphors* in mind. Since I'm interested in neuroscience, the name seemed fitting. For example, in neuroscience, chemical synapses are the most abundant type of synapse in the brain. A chemical synapse consist of two pillars: 1) a signaling neuron and 2) a target neuron. Information transfer in the brain occurs via the release of chemicals from the signaling neuron into what's called a synaptic cleft. When the signal is propogated, chemical neurotransmitters flood into the synaptic cleft. The molecules (proteins and what not) in the cleft modulate the uptake of the neurotransmitters by the target neuron. For its part, the target neuron modulates and propogates the signalling neurons "message". 

Obviously, the above story is grossly oversimplified. But, it is not like we're in a current hsitorical period where the entire story is available. There's still mystery surrounding the function and make-up of the extracellular fluid in the synaptic cleft. 

Nonetheless, just like the keystone in an Arch, or the clergy members presiding over mass in a Catholic cathedral, or the center of mass around which planets orbit, the synaptic cleft component of the synapase is a crucial component to understand if you want to get clear about what exactly a synpase is. And the domain name www.syn-haptein.com, refers to my theoretical interests: languages and brains.
