Syn-haptein is just a weird way to spell the familiar word 'synapse'. Most of us already have a vague idea of what a synapse is. It's the connection between two cells in the brain, right? Sure. That's it. (If you're satisfied with that description, click <a href="http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Peirce%201878%20Make%20Ideas%20Clear.pdf"> here </a>.) 
				
Anyway, the purpose of spelling 'synapse' in this way isn't to be weird. I wanted to segment the linguistic root of synapse from its affix. Why should I do that? Maybe it's because I can thereby fully contemplate the historical derivation and origin of our current "form of life". Maybe. 

Or maybe I'm just really bored and I wanted to learn how to code a jekyll site. You feel me? 


Anyway consider the root of the word synapse: 'apse'. The word 'apse' refers to the semicircular region at the back of a Catholic cathedral. Look at an apse:

There's another linguistic form closely related to 'apse': the Ionic cognate word 'apsis' or what's the same, the Greeek 'haptein'. An apsis is an astronomical term that we currently use to refer to either one of the extreme values on an orbit around a fixed point.

Notice any commonalities beteween these two lingusitic forms? How about this. Both apse and apsis have in common three spatial points. In the case of a Roman Catholic church, the three points for are 1) the faithful lay-members of the church, 2) the clergy presiding over the mass and 3) the blessed sacrament held in the tabernacle behind the clergy.  In the case of an eliptical orbit around a center of mass, the three points are 1) the max distance from the center of mass, 2) the min distance, and  3) the center of mass itself.

Can you see why Martin Luther might have wanted to post his notes on the church door? Excuse me. I digress. 

Anyway, what about the affix 'syn'? The affix isn't supposed to carry meaning apart from the root. So syn- just omes from the Greek word meaning, 'together' or 'with'. 

Go back and try to synthesize the meanings I've suggsted for the root and the affix of synapse. Notice antyhing? 

What I conclude for the meaning of synapse is this: 1) A synapse n. "two dependent parts and a single reference part that function together as a unit". 

Let me shift focus again. 

Pure Archs  

A bit of historical background and then a question. 

By some estimates, Archs appeared in the historical record at the transition from the middle to the late Bronze age (2000-1000 BCE). A mere 4000 years ago. This was about the same time that syllabic writing systems emerged in the historical record. This is important because what a syllabic writing system does is pair a humanly produced acoustic signal with an arbitrary visuospatial pattern. It's hard not to see the analogy between an the abstract meaning I've suggested for 'apse' and syllabic writing systems. For the development of a syllabic writing system to make practical sense, a minimum of three "points" (ad I use the term points here loosely) are required - 1) a visuspatial pattern, 2) a sound pattern, and 3) a referential bond between the former two points. I digress, but I hope you see the analogy. 

How do Archs work?

I won't pretend to be an expert on Arch building, but here's a shot.

Pure Archs (as they are called) work by elimating pull (also known as tensile stress) and supporting themselves based on the push of the columns (compressive stress). So, a Pure Arch is built into a reference point known as a keystone. The keystone is the center reference point at the top of the Arch. Blocks are laid simultaneously from both bottom ends until each curved pillar  finally meets at the center keystone. In this way, the blocks forming the pillars of the Arch push together on the keystone and they thereby stablize themselves with compressive stress. I'd hate to be the keystone in that relationship.

So what does syn-haptein mean?  

What does any of this have to do with the domain-name www.syn-haptein.com?  

Well, I chose the domain-name with the above metaphors in mind. First, I'm primarily interested in neuroscience. So in neuroscience, chemical synapses are the most abundant type of synapse in the brain. A chemical synapse consist of two pillars: 1) a signaling neuron and 2) a target neuron. Information transfer in the brain occurs via the release of chemicals from the presynaptic neuron signaling neuron into what's called the synaptic cleft. When the signal is propogated, chemical neurotransmitters flood into the synaptic cleft. But, don't be confused. The synaptic cleft isn't just empty space. The molecules (proteins and what not) in the cleft modulate the uptake of the neurotransmitters by the postsynaptic neuron. In turn, the postsynaptic neuron modulates and propogates the presynaptic neurons "message" (modulated also by the chemical consistency of the cleft). Obviously, I over simplify. But, even if I didn't, there's still a great deal of mystery surrounding the make-up of the extracellular fluid in the synaptic cleft. With the analogies above, I hope to have pointed you toward an interesting idea. Just like the keystone in an Arch, or the clergy in a Catholic cathedral, or the center of mass around which planets orbit, the synaptic cleft component of the synapase is a curcial element to understand if you want to get clear about what exactly a synpase is.
