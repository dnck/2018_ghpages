What sense can we derive from the historical origin of the word 'synapse'? 

Why bother asking such a question? 

Because [C.S. Peirce persauded me that I would benefit from making my ideas clear]({{ pdf.url }}/pdfs/PeirceHowToMakeIdeasClear.pdf)

So, step one and two. Segment the linguistic root of synapse from its affix and inspect their origins. 

The root of the word synapse is 'apse'. The word 'apse' refers to the semicircular region at the back of a Catholic cathedral. Here's an image of an apse:

![cathedr_floor]({{ thisImg.url }}/images/cathedr_floorplan_new.jpg){:height="350px" width="600px"}.

The Ionic word 'apsis' and the Greek word, 'haptein', are cognate linguistic forms closely related to 'apse'. Let's focus only on apsis. 

An apsis is an astronomical term used to refer to either one of the extreme values on an orbit around a fixed point. Here's an image:

![apogee]({{ thisImg.url }}/images/apogee.png){:height="256px" width="400px"}.

Both apse and apsis have in common a reference to three spatial points. 

In the case of an apse, the three points are: 

1) the faithful lay-members of the church, 
2) the clergy presiding over the mass and 
3) the blessed sacrament held in the tabernacle behind the clergy.  

In the case of an eliptical orbit around a center of a mass, the three points are 
1) the max distance from the center of mass, 
2) the min distance, and  
3) the center of mass itself. 

What about the affix 'syn'? First of all, that an affix isn't supposed to carry much meaning apart from the root  its attached to, so I won't make much ado about syn. Just note, syn comes from the Greek word meaning, 'together' or 'with'. 

Step three. Synthesize the original sense for the root and the affix. 

1) a 'synapse' refers to "two dependent parts with a single reference point - all of which function together as a unit". 

That sounds so wrong - even to the person that wrote it - me! File this in the failed projects bin. However, I did successfully learn how to code a Jekyll site - and make posts in markdown with pictures - that's something, right?
