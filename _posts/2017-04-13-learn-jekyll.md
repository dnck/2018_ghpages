I've wanted to migrate my blogging away from wordpress for awhile. Honestly, wordpress is confusing. Who needs SQL databases and all that other fancy stuff for a simple blog? This website is hosted on github and its powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I use Markdown to write my posts and git to update my blog. I'll share some thoughts, code, and projects as they develop.
