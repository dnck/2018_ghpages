I have wanted to get rid of my dependence on wordpress for some time. Who really needs SQL databases and all the other complicated crap for a simple blog? This website is hosted on github powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Best of all, I can use Markdown to author my posts. I will share some code, and other stuff as I finish projects.
