I'm launching my new personal blog/website today for three reasons. 

First, I want to learn how the framework underlying the blog works. Second, I want to write regularly in a creative way again. Third, I want to share my experiencce and writing with as many people as possible. I'm not trying to market myself, I just think that most ideas need to be structured by alternative perspectives before they're good and ready to put into practice. 

I plan to share two blog posts today. I also have a list of blog posts planned out. You can comment on the list once I do the third post.

Future Blog Posts
* ~~Launch the blog. Why?~~  Done!
* ~~Linguists are like aliens!~~ Done!
* ~~What's the sense in looking at historical records?~~ Done!
* How can I comment on your blog posts?
* Writing systems. What do they say about human cognition and its evolution?
* What is a combinatorial tool? Are they special? Do they reveal anything important about human as opposed to merely animal cognition?
* What is the root and affix for the word synapse? 
* What are archs? How are they built? What are their parts?
* Definition of polynomials with plotting examples
* Argument for open access publishing 
* Can we derive any important insights from article level metrics? What would a plot look like in plot.ly javascript? What can we do with the impactstory JSON data?
* How did I configure my server for git? Why did I do it? 
* What is a Markov process? Why should you care?
* What is the difference between serial and parallel processing in cognitive science?
* What happened to my EEG project with the BSMB post-docs? Where is the code? Is it just junk code?
* What is the result of my online behavioral experiment? What was the purpose of the experiment?
* Where is my python tweet loop code? Is it just junk?
* Where is my cv? Where will I be after the master's program?
* Where is my public PGP key in case you want to send me an encrypted message?
* What is the script for pixelating my picture? Why do it? 

So it's a bit of a jumble, but there's three themes: a) cognitive science and language, 2) computer science and math, 3) personal stuff with some code thrown in.

I will return to this blog post and cross things out as I complete the list. The goal is to finish by the new year.
