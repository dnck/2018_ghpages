I'm launching my new personal blog/website today for three reasons. 

First, I want to learn how the framework underlying the blog works. Second, I want to write regularly in a creative way again. Third, I want to share my experiencce and writing with as many people as possible. I'm not trying to market myself, I just think that most ideas need to be structured by alternative perspectives before they're good and ready to put into practice. 

I plan to share two blog posts today. I also have a list of blog posts planned out. You can comment on the list once I do the third post.

Future Blog Posts
1) ~~ Launch the blog. Why? ~~ Done!
2) ~~ Linguists are like aliens! ~~ Done!
3) ~~ What's the sense in looking at historical records? ~~ Done!
1) How can I comment on your blog posts?
2) Writing systems. What do they say about human cognition and its evolution?
3) What is a combinatorial tool? Are they special? Do they reveal anything important about human as opposed to merely animal cognition?
4) What is the root and affix for the word synapse? 
5) What are archs? How are they built? What are their parts?
6) Definition of polynomials with plotting examples
7) Argument for open access publishing 
8) Can we derive any important insights from article level metrics? What would a plot look like in plot.ly javascript? What can we do with the impactstory JSON data?
9) How did I configure my server for git? Why did I do it? 
10) What is a Markov process? Why should you care?
11) What is the difference between serial and parallel processing in cognitive science?
12) What happened to my EEG project with the BSMB post-docs? Where is the code? Is it just junk code?
13) What is the result of my online behavioral experiment? What was the purpose of the experiment?
14) Where is my python tweet loop code? Is it just junk?
15) Where is my cv? Where will I be after the master's program?
16) Where is my public PGP key in case you want to send me an encrypted message?
17) What is the script for pixelating my picture? Why do it? 

So it's a bit of a jumble, but there's three themes: a) cognitive science and language, 2) computer science and math, 3) personal stuff with some code thrown in.

I will return to this blog post and cross things out as I complete the list. The goal is to finish by the new year.
