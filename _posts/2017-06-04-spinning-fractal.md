I used a combination of tools to create the above fractal: 1) (Nodebox)[https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home], 2) typical python modules like PIL, and lastly 3) (ffmpeg)[http://ffmpeg.org/]. If you like it, I can create you one! Just let me know. I've got plans to create another one (just for fun) that changes colors and expands and contracts. It's too bad it takes a while to load.
