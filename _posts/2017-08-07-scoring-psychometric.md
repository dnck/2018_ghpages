I recently had to score some psychometric-span tasks, e.g. the Digit-Span task, the Corsi-Block-Tapping task, and the Tower of Hanoi task. I did a survey of the literature, and I have to say, it's filled with a shit-ton of different proposals for scoring these tasks. Unfortunately, the software I used for measuring didn't give me all of these scores, so I had to write a script myself. In the interest of transparency, <a href="www.danjcook.com/assets/psychometric.html">here's a link to a notebook</a> that justifies a few of the measures I might end up using.
