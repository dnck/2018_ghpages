Is it possible to derive the current sense of a word from its historical origins?

My intuition says, "yes". If you inspected the sense of the root of a word and any of its affixes, and you followed the word's parts back in time, then you'd eventually derive the current sense of the word from its history.

If you share this intuition, then you might want to consider two problems.

First problem. It would take you a very long time to trace the sense of a single part of a word. If you relied only on dictionaries, then you'd still be looking at around 4000 years of evidence (oldest surviving dictionary ~ 2300 BCE). If you included ancient logographic writing systems you go even further back in time, and you'd be working with "big data". You'd probably run out of time and die before you'd even derived the sense of a single word.

Second problem. there's gaps in the historical record. Time's probably already got you beat. It's probably true that some of the essential parts of the records that you'd need to draw a convincing conclusion were destroyed a long time ago. But, there's a chance it wasn't destroyed, so you'd still have a chance.

Third problem. Even if you did follow the history of a single words sense all the way back to to its origin, there'd probably be a lot of people that said your explanation was bullshit. It may depend on how much convincing you need, but even if you didn't need much convincing, you'd probably feel a sinking suspicion that they were right.

So, OK. We've acknowledged two obstacles to the project of deriving the sense of words from a historical record. Importantly, if time is the only issue, then there might be <a href="http://nws.merriam-webster.com/opendictionary/newword_display_recent.php">some words</a> that are open to investigation, and because of digitial records, it might become easier and easier for the future generations to engage with the project (even though they'd be limited with respect to the pre-digital era as we are).
