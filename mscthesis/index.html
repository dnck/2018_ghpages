<h2>Supplement to "The Effects of Lexical Retrieval and Recursive Arithmetic on the
Discrimination of Fractal Patterns"</h2>
<p>The purpose of this page is to supply additional analysis of the data obtained during my master's thesis project. The primary goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that rule based visual categorization of recursive hierarchies can only be accomplished by relying on the human language in the narrow sense. We tested this hypothesis with a dual task paradigm. Participants in our study categorized fractals and non-fractal patterns during three conditions of dual task interference. In the semantic condition, participants needed to name instances of general categories aloud. In the math condition, participants were given starting value at the start of the visual categorization task, and they needed to compute the arithmetic sequence, N = N - 3, during its execution. In a visual condition, participants needed to memorize a checker board pattern before the main task, and after, recognize it among distractors. In the thesis, I compared accuracy and response time during these three conditions of dual task interference to a condition of no interference ("regular") for both the recursive and non-recursive rule based visual categorization of patterns. Due to space constraints in the thesis, the current supplement reports the results of different analytic approaches to analyzing the behavioral data. We also include a report on correlations between psychometric scores on different exams and the measures in the two primary experiments of the thesis.</p>
